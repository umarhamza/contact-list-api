# My Contacts

- This repo is the code for the contact list api web app project I created.

- This app loads names from the [UI Names API](https://uinames.com/){:target="_blank"} in an object.

- The app filters the object list of names and arranges them in alphabetical order.

- You can search through the contacts by name and it will filter the contact list below.
